[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgeometry_megs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "geometry_megs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "geometry_megs"
  with any of the following names:

    geometry_megsConfig.cmake
    geometry_megs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "geometry_megs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "geometry_megs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "geometry_megs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
