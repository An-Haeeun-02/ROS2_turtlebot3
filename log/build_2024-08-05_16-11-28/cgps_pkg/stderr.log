[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcsignal.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "csignal", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "csignal" with any
  of the following names:

    csignalConfig.cmake
    csignal-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "csignal" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "csignal_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "csignal" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
