[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlibgpsmm.h.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "libgpsmm.h", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "libgpsmm.h" with
  any of the following names:

    libgpsmm.hConfig.cmake
    libgpsmm.h-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "libgpsmm.h" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "libgpsmm.h_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "libgpsmm.h" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
